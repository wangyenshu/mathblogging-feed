It loosely tracks a set of lectures that Meehl gave in 1989 at the University of Minnesota. In it, he surveys of the philosophy of science, lays out a framework for scientific debate, and critiques scientific practice. Recht summarizes his arguments, simplifies the ideas, provides examples, and offers his own commentary, considering today’s computerized world.",
